# Image Processing Tool

The Image Processing Tool is a simple Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to rename and/or resize a batch of images within a selected directory. This tool is especially useful for tasks like organizing and preparing images for various projects.

## Features

- Rename images by appending a project name and an index to the original file names.
- Resize images by specifying a percentage of the original dimensions.
- Option to choose between renaming, resizing, or both.
- Dynamic update of the resize percentage label based on the slider value.
- Ability to process images in bulk within a selected directory.
- User-friendly GUI for easy interaction.
